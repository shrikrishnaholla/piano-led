piano-led
=========

tl;dr, a web based piano that makes LEDs blink (in the server, through Arduino)

I set this up, exposed my dev server through a localtunnel, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/srikrishnaholla/status/546371120346062848) it

And forgot about it after some time. I started taking a video and after some time, realized I wasn't the only guy playing it (starts at 0:58). You can see after 1:08 that it continues playing even after I stop. That's someone on the public internet lighting up the LEDs using the link I had tweeted.

Running it yourself
===================
- Prepare the circuit according to the [second exercise on node-ardx](http://node-ardx.org/exercises/2)
- Clone this repo
- Run ```npm install```
- Run the server ```DEBUG=piano-led* npm start```
- Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), start a tunnel on PORT 3000 (or whichever one you are using)
- Go to the URL, "Start broadcasting" will be disabled. Enable it using your epic JS skills, and start broadcasting
- Point your webcam to the circuit and share the URL with your friends, and wait for epicness to unfurl

Why? Because we can!
